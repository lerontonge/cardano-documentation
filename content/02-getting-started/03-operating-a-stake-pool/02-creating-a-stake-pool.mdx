### Prerequisites for stake pool operators

As a stake pool operator for Cardano, you will typically have the following
abilities:

- operational knowledge of how to set up, run and maintain a Cardano node
  continuously
- a commitment to maintain your node 24/7/365
- system operation skills
- server administration skills (operational and maintenance).
- experience of development and operations (DevOps) would be very useful

**Hardware requirements**

In terms of hardware, you should ensure you have the following:

- 10 GB of RAM
- 24 GB of hard disk space
- a good network connection and about 1 GB of bandwidth per hour
- a public IP4 address

Note that processor speed is not a significant factor for running a stake pool.

### Stake pool installation instructions

To learn how to set up your own stake pool, follow the [installing the node from source instructions](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/doc/getting-started/install.md).

You can then proceed with the following operational tasks for managing your stake pool:

- [Getting configuration files](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/doc/stake-pool-operations/getConfigFiles_AND_Connect.md)
