## Getting started with third party integration

<Info info>
  Exchanges interested in or currently listing ada should move to a
  Shelley-supported version of Cardano.
</Info>

<Info warn>

Old components like **cardano-sl:node**, **cardano-sl:explorer**,
**cardano-sl:wallet** will not be supported after the Shelley Hard-fork.

</Info>

Only the following components are Shelley compliant and will be supported during
and after the Shelley hard-fork and support both Byron and Shelley eras.

- [`cardano-node`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node) - the latest
  cardano-node, which supports Ouroboros Praos.

- [`cardano-db-sync`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync) - a
  necessary middleware to power both cardano-rest and cardano-graphql. This
  middleware stores blockchain data fetched from cardano-node in an intermediate
  database to enable higher-level interfaces for blockchain exploration.

- [`cardano-wallet`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet) - This
  API is recommended for 3rd party wallets and exchanges who do not want to
  manage UTxOs for transactions themselves. Use it to send and receive payments
  from hierarchical deterministic wallets on the Cardano blockchain via HTTP
  REST or a command-line interface.

- [`cardano-rest`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-rest) - is made of
  two HTTP APIs that are used to retrieve transactions, addresses, and time
  periods (epochs and slots) from the cardano-db-sync component and submit an
  already serialized transaction to the network using cardano-explorer-api &
  cardano-submit-api respectively. The cardano-submit-api uses the same API as
  the cardano-sl:explorer to ease migration from already integrated clients. New
  integration should, however, look into cardano-graphql.

- [`cardano-graphql`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-graphql) - HTTP
  GraphQL API for Cardano. A more flexible alternative for blockchain
  exploration than cardano-rest.

- [`Adrestia libraries`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/adrestia) -
  Recommended for larger exchanges who wish to construct their own wallet scheme
  and manage UTXOs themselves. This consists of the following:

  - [`cardano-coin-selection`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-coin-selection)
  - [`cardano-addresses`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-addresses)
  - [`cardano-transactions`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-transactions)
  - [`cardano-serialization-lib`](https://github.com/Emurgo/cardano-serialization-lib)
  - [`bech32`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0173.mediawiki)

The only currently available language target is Haskell, although support for
JavaScript is being worked on and should be available soon.

<Info warn>

Adrestiaâ€™s components and their respective repositories are also listed on
[`Github`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/adrestia/).
