metaTitle: Getting started with the Cardano testnet
---

To get started and join the Cardano testnet, you should install and configure the Cardano node and the command line interface (CLI), and generate payment keys and addresses. Note, that you will also need [to get some test ada](/cardano-testnet/tools/faucet) to test your transactions, which will be possible to monitor using [Cardano Testnet Explorer](https://explorer.cardano-testnet.iohkdev.io/en) or [Testnet Cardanoscan](https://testnet.cardanoscan.io/), for example.

## System requirements

The Cardano node can run on the following platforms:

-   Linux Ubuntu 19.10 (Eoan Ermine) or later
-   Linux Mint 19.3 (Tricia) or later
-   Linux Debian 10.3 (Buster) or later
-   MacOSX 10.14.0 (Mojave) or later
-   Windows 10

## Installing the node

Download the latest version of the node:

-   [Cardano node releases](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/releases)

Check your executables. The latest versions of the Cardano node and CLI can be found here:

-   [Cardano node executables](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node#executables)
    
There are a number of ways to install and run a Cardano node on testnet. The choice of the best-matching method depends on the operating system, level of technical expertise, and personal preferences.

Building the node using Nix is the recommended method, as this is what IOG’s internal development teams use and is considered the most reliable.

For more information on the various options, see:

-   [Building the node using Nix](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/doc/getting-started/building-the-node-using-nix.md)
-   [Building the node from source](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/doc/getting-started/install.md/)
-   [Building the node using Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/inputoutput/cardano-node)
    
When installing the node, it is also essential to build the [cardano-client](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/tree/master/cardano-client-demo). This tool is built similarly to the node. Since it is so fundamental, all tutorials that build the node also build the client.

## Configurations

To start working with the node, it is essential to ensure that the node configuration, genesis and topology files are correctly set up. In addition, the node will need the configuration files specific to each era that the Cardano network has experienced thus far.

These configurations tell the node how to handle the updates that come with each era (ie. Mary, Alonzo, Babbage, etc). Each new era (implemented using the [hard fork combinator technology](https://docs.cardano.org/core-concepts/about-hard-forks)) introduces protocol changes and new ledger rules. While old configurations are still valid, the new configurations and features offer new rules and improvements. In the Babbage era, for example, Plutus v2 scripts work better than Plutus v1 scripts. Plutus v1 scripts, however, are still supported. 

For more details, see:

-   [Understanding configuration files](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/doc/getting-started/understanding-config-files.md)

## Environments

### Early-stage testing networks

**Vasil devnet**

Vasil devnet is the network for early involvement and functionality testing before a release candidate is mature. It is meant for projects such as DApps that wish to explore new features as soon as they are available.

- **Current era** : Babbage
- **Epoch length** : 2h
- **Plutus versions** : Plutus V1 and Plutus V2
- **Cost model** : Plutus V2 updated

[**Devnet configurations**](https://book.world.dev.cardano.org/environments.html#vasil-dev)

**Preview**

Preview is the longer-term network environment for testing release candidates and expanded test scenarios. Preview is meant for DApps, stake pool operators (SPOs), and exchanges who wish to test mature release candidates.

- **Current era** : Babbage
- **Epoch length** : 1 day
- **Plutus versions** : Plutus V1 and Plutus V2
- **Cost model** : Plutus V2 updated

[**Preview configurations**](https://book.world.dev.cardano.org/environments.html#preview-testnet)

### Late-stage testing networks

**Pre-production**

Pre-production is the most mature network for testing purposes, which resembles a production (mainnet) environment. It is meant for exchanges, SPOs, pre-deployment DApps, and wallets that wish to test release functionality before deploying on mainnet.

- **Current era** : Alonzo.
- **Epoch length** : 5 days
- **Plutus versions** : Plutus V1
- **Cost model** : Plutus V2 _not_ updated

[**Pre-production configurations**](https://book.world.dev.cardano.org/environments.html#pre-production-testnet)


>Note that the **Cardano testnet** is no longer recommended for testing purposes. It will be deprecated in several months, and the community is encouraged to use the environments listed above for functionality testing. Currently, the testnet supports node v.1.35.0, v.1.35.1, and v.1.35.2. It _does not_ support node v.1.35.3, which is a Vasil release candidate.

**Production network (mainnet)**

Production is the live network, also referred to as mainnet. It features official functionality releases. Exchanges, SPOs, DApps, wallets, and end users can use the mainnet for development, transaction processing, and other needs.

- **Current era** : Alonzo
- **Epoch length** : 5 days
- **Plutus versions** : Plutus V1
- **Cost model** : Plutus V2 _not_ updated

[**Production configurations**](https://book.world.dev.cardano.org/environments.html#production-mainnet)

## Working with the Cardano testnet

Note that mainnet and testnet commands are very similar except for the flag usage. For example, when interacting with cardano-cli on mainnet, you should add the `--mainnet` flag. However, to use the same commands on testnet, you should use the `--testnet-magic INTEGER` flag instead. 

`INTEGER` indicates the number of the testnet:
* Vasil devnet integer is `9`
* Preview integer is `2`
* Pre-production integer is `1`
* Public testnet integer is `1097911063`. (*Note that the testnet will be deprecated soon and is not recommended for Vasil functionality testing*)

### Creating keys and addresses

To send and receive transactions, you should first create the payment key pair:

```
cardano-cli address key-gen \
--verification-key-file payment.vkey \
--signing-key-file payment.skey
```

This creates two files: `payment.vkey` (the public verification key) and `payment.skey` (the private signing key).

Both verification keys (payment.vkey and stake.vkey) are used to build the address and the resulting payment address is associated with these keys.

To build the address, run:

```
cardano-cli address build \
--payment-verification-key-file payment.vkey \
--stake-verification-key-file stake.vkey \
--out-file payment.addr \
--testnet-magic INTEGER
```

To query the balance of the address, run:

```
cardano-cli query utxo \
--address $(cat payment.addr) \
--testnet-magic INTEGER
```

For more commands, see:

-   [Creating keys and addresses](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/doc/stake-pool-operations/keys_and_addresses.md)
    
Note to use the `--testnet-magic INTEGER` flag instead of `--mainnet`.

### Funding the address using a faucet

To fund your testnet address, go to the testnet faucet and request some test ada:

-   [The testnet faucet](/cardano-testnet/tools/faucet)

If you're working in a *pre-production environment* and have an API key, you can run the following command to fund your address:

`curl -X POST -s 'https://faucet.preprod.world.dev.cardano.org/send-money/YOURADDRESS?api_key=YOURAPIKEY'`

### Creating, signing, and submitting transactions

You’re now ready to create, sign, and submit transactions on testnet. See the tutorial:

-   [Building and signing transactions](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/doc/reference/building-and-signing-tx.md)
    
Note to use the `--testnet-magic INTEGER` flag instead of `--mainnet`.
