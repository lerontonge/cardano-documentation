The Cardano testnet sits at the vanguard of the network development. It provides a sandboxed environment for continuing innovation, harnessing the power of the Cardano community to iterate and improve.

The Cardano testnet gives stake pool operators, smart contract developers, and projects the opportunity to actively test core Cardano functionality prior to deploying on mainnet. 

The Cardano testnet has now been upgraded to Vasil functionality. Find out more about the Vasil upgrade and features in the following sections.
