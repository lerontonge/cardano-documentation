Welcome to the contribution guidelines for the Cardano Ecosystem Tools section!

This is a space where Cardano ecosystem developers can share useful tutorials, guidelines, and overviews related to development on the Cardano blockchain. You can contribute by sharing your expertise, insights, and experience with the Cardano community.

Follow these steps to add your contribution:

1. Open a pull request on the Cardano Docs repository.
2. Create a new file with a short, meaningful heading, such as 'Build with X' or 'Deploy DApps with Y'. Use Markdown formatting to structure your content.
3. Note that the title will be created based on the details that should be added as a header. For example:

```
---
title: Build Web3 apps with Mesh SDK
metaTitle: Build Web3 apps with Mesh SDK
---
```

4. Ensure that your content follows the common structure outlined below:

* Start with a short description of the proposed tool or solution. For example, ‘Mesh SDK is an open-source library for building Web3 applications on the  Cardano blockchain’. Then, continue with H2 headings and so on.
* Provide an overview of the proposed tool or solution.
* Outline the main features or benefits of the proposed solution.
* Provide a general step-by-step guide on how to get started.
* Add useful links and references to other material.
* Include relevant code snippets or examples to illustrate your points.
* Respond to feedback and comments from the community and the Cardano Docs team.

5. Style notes:

* Use gerunds for task-based headings, for example, ‘Getting started with…’, ‘Installing X’, ‘Integrating with’, etc.
* Style is initial caps. Please capitalize only the first word in the heading unless using proper names or product names.

Finally, note that there are no strict guidelines, only useful suggestions!

Your contributions will help others learn and build on the Cardano blockchain using a variety of ecosystem solutions. We believe that Cardano Ecosystem Tools will become a valuable resource for the Cardano developer community, and can't wait to see what you will create!

> Cardano Ecosystem Tools is currently a work in progress. With time, dedicated sub-sections can be created to organize content based on the topic of discussion.
