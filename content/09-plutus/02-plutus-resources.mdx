## Plutus developer resources

The scope of the Plutus developer resources section includes such topics:

-   Plutus Core    
-   Plutus Tools   
-   Official Haskell language server implementation  
-   Cardano node API documentation
    
### Plutus Core

Plutus Core is the scripting language embedded in the Cardano ledger. It forms the basis of the Plutus Platform – an application development platform for developing decentralized applications (DApps) on the Cardano blockchain.

**Developer resources**:

-   [Plutus Core GitHub repository](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus): includes the implementation, specification, and mechanized metatheory of Plutus Core as well as Plutus Tx – the compiler from Haskell to Plutus Core.
    
**Associated links**:

-   [Talks](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus#talks)    
-   [Specifications and design](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus#specifications-and-design)    
-   [Academic papers](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus#academic-papers)
    
### Plutus Tools

Plutus Tools is a collection of off-chain infrastructure resources built for external developers. The Plutus Tools SDK repository supports the necessary underlying resources for writing applications using Plutus in Haskell.

Plutus Tools also provide libraries for working with the Plutus Application Framework (PAF) – the off-chain part of the Plutus Platform that enables DApp development and interaction with smart contracts.

**Developer resources**:

-   [Plutus Tools GitHub repository](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-apps): includes libraries that implement the PAF, a selection of end-to-end use cases written with the PAF, and details about Plutus Playground.
   
**Associated links**:

-   [Talks](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-apps#talks) 
-   [Specifications and design](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-apps#specifications-and-design)
    
### Official Haskell language server implementation

Haskell language server implementation is an implementation of a server for the Language Server Protocol (LSP). A language server talks to a client, who can ask the server to perform various operations, such as reporting errors or providing code completions.

**Developer resources**:

-   [Haskell language server documentation](https://haskell-language-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
    
### Cardano node API documentation

**Developer resources**:

-   [Cardano node API documentation](https://input-output-hk.github.io/cardano-node/): the Haddock-generated documentation for the Cardano node API.
