## SMASH Handbook

The **SMASH Handbook** (‘Handbook’) compiles all the information currently
available about the **Stake Pool Metadata Aggregation Server (SMASH)**,
including background, rationale for its introduction, and technical details.

### Audience

This Handbook is intended for Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) who might want to
register their pools' metadata, and anyone who wants to acquire an understanding
of what SMASH does, and how it works.

## INTRODUCTION

Cardano Shelley introduced the concept of stake pools - reliable server nodes
that keep an aggregated stake of pool operators and delegators in a single
entity. Stake pools are registered on-chain, and their on-chain data (such as
information required to calculate rewards) is critical to the operation of the
ledger. Stake pools also possess metadata that helps users to make a rational
choice of a stake pool to delegate to. This metadata is stored off-chain, as it
might reflect sensitive content. Such an approach allows for a certain degree of
decentralized censorship.

But on the other hand, off-chain metadata storage poses a challenge of open
access by different users. On-chain stake pool registrations contain an URL
pointer to the off-chain metadata and a content hash that can be fetched from a
specific stake pool. This might cause both performance and privacy issues.
Another crucial aspect to address is the stake pool’s “ticker” name, which is
the short name a stake pool is recognized by. Ticker names might reflect
prominent brands or trademarks that should not be duplicated, as this might lead
to confusion. SPOs running multiple pools might want to use the same metadata
for all their pools, for example, which might lead to these pools appearing with
the same ticker name. This would not be an ideal situation.

To support stake pool operations and provide visibility over the delegation
ecosystem, we have created a Stake Pool Metadata Aggregation Server – SMASH. In
this Handbook, we overview SMASH’s standardized framework for listing valid
stake pools with verified metadata, and provide instructions on working with it.

## LEARN ABOUT SMASH

The purpose of SMASH is to aggregate off-chain metadata that stake pools provide
when they register on the Cardano blockchain.

This metadata might include:

- owner
- pool name
- pool ticker
- homepage
- pledge address
- short description

The integrity and reputation of Cardano depends on ensuring that registered
stake pools are valid, that they do not duplicate ticker names or trademarks,
and do not feature content that users are likely to find offensive. SMASH was
designed to improve visibility on verified stake pool information for Cardano
users and enable convenient navigation options.

The first generation of SMASH was initially deployed by IOHK and is currently
used in the Daedalus delegation center, where it enables users to view available
stake pools with verified names, ticker symbols, websites, and short
descriptions. The functionality provided by SMASH supports stake pool operations
and the delegation ecosystem with its standardized framework for listing valid
stake pools with verified metadata.

### SMASH Rationale

The rationale for introducing a metadata aggregation server in the Cardano
architecture is two-fold:

- to keep the stake pool metadata stored off-chain; and
- to retain the ability to moderate stake pool metadata, without any centralized
  censor.

The metadata is hosted off-chain and referred to from the on-chain pool
registration. SMASH collects the off-chain data to make it more convenient,
performant, and reliable for wallets and other applications to access it.

The SMASH server also addresses a second consideration: the desire to moderate
the content of stake pool metadata without a centralized censoring entity. For
example, most wallet users and stake pool operators would like to have the
ability to treat stake pool ticker names as if they were unique trademarks. It
would be too complex to have a fair, on-chain system to resolve ticker name
disputes. So instead of enforcing uniqueness on chain, this can optionally be
enforced by filtering the metadata as part of metadata aggregation. Multiple
aggregation services can be run by different organizations following different
policies on filtering stake pool metadata, which enables wallet users and other
consumers of stake pool metadata to choose which policy to follow, if any.

SMASH can be configured with policies to filter out metadata based on block
lists or reserved ticker names. Daedalus can be configured to use any SMASH
server. You can also find more information about the pool metadata (the
[PoolMetaData record](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/blob/4458fdba7e2211f63e7f28ecd3f9b55b02eee071/shelley/chain-and-ledger/executable-spec/src/Shelley/Spec/Ledger/TxData.hs#L62))
and read the Design Specification for Delegation and Incentives in Cardano
([section 4.2 Stake Pool Metadata, p.30](https://hydra.iohk.io/build/790053/download/1/delegation_design_spec.pdf)).

### SMASH Use Cases

As SMASH is introduced to address metadata performance and privacy issues,
delegators, stake pool operators, exchanges, or wallets can deploy and use SMASH
to ensure a higher level of metadata accountability and maintenance. Exchanges,
wallets, or other SPOs then act as operators and can validate and manage this
metadata, or curate it for censorship via the delisting feature.

Exchanges, for example, can use SMASH to fetch stake pool metadata and verify
its content against the on-chain registered hash. The exchange can then check
existing metadata for correctness (size limits, content, etc.), create new stake
pools manually, and reserve their ticker names. If there is a stake pool with a
duplicated ticker name, counterfeit, or offensive content, it will be possible
to delist this pool.

There are many other use cases for running SMASH servers besides censorship: an
operator might choose to list only charity pools or pools from a certain region
for ada holders who would prefer to support locally-operated stake pool
businesses, for example.

It is expected that more operators will use SMASH servers for metadata curation.
As more servers come online, they can be added to a list of preferred SMASH
servers within the Daedalus wallet.

## INSTALLING A SMASH SERVER

### Prerequisites

You can find the most recent installation instructions in the respective
[SMASH GitHub repository](https://github.com/input-output-hk/smash/blob/master/doc/getting-started/how-to-install-smash.md#prerequisites).

The following components **must** be downloaded and installed before building,
installing, and deploying SMASH. It is not necessary to install the Cardano
wallet or any other Cardano components.

- The **PostgreSQL library**. This can be installed on Linux using e.g.,
  `apt install libpq-dev`
- The **PostgreSQL server**. This can be installed on Linux using e.g.,
  `apt install postgresql`
- The **cardano-db-sync package**. This acts as a library for database support,
  hence, it is not necessary to install it separately.
- The **cardano-node package**. This provides the core Cardano node
  functionality and runs as a passive node.

### Step-by-Step Installation Instructions

Follow these steps to install a SMASH server:

1. **Create a database (DB)**

Create a database and provide its path. This installation example uses the
default location. Use this command to create the PostgreSQL database:

`SMASHPGPASSFILE=config/pgpass ./scripts/postgresql-setup.sh --createdb`

To recreate the database (if needed), run the following command:

`SMASHPGPASSFILE=config/pgpass ./scripts/postgresql-setup.sh --recreatedb`

After that, you can run migrations (if there are any):

`SMASHPGPASSFILE=config/pgpass cabal run smash-exe -- run-migrations --mdir ./schema`

Run additional migration scripts if they need to be created:

`SMASHPGPASSFILE=config/pgpass cabal run smash-exe -- create-migration --mdir ./schema`

**Useful commands:**

- To show all tables: `\dt`
- To show details about a specific table: `\d+ TABLE_NAME`. For example:
  `\d+ block`
- You can dump the schema with:
  `pg_dump -c -s --no-owner cexplorer > cexplorer.sql`

2. **Install SMASH**

You can build and install SMASH from the command line using `cabal` as follows:

```
cabal build smash
cabal install smash
```

You can also use stack if you prefer. If you’re already using `cabal`, replace
`cabal` with `stack` in the commands above.

### Running SMASH with the Cardano node

1. First, run the Cardano node as a relay, or passive node.

For example:

`cardano-node --genesis-file genesis.json --socket-path node.socket --config config.yaml`

You can then run SMASH using:

`SMASHPGPASSFILE=./config/pgpass cabal run smash-exe -- run-app-with-db-sync --config config.yaml --socket-path node.socket --schema-dir schema/`

You can also run a mainnet node using a Nix command:

`nix-build -A scripts.mainnet.node -o mainnet-node-local./mainnet-node-local`

**Useful Commands**

From the HTTP API, SMASH supports the fetching of the metadata using:

curl --verbose --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request GET
http://localhost:3100/api/v1/metadata/<POOL_ID>/<POOL_HASH>

If you are an administrator, you can delist a pool as follows:

`curl --verbose --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request PATCH --data '{"poolId":"<POOL_ID>"}' http://localhost:3100/api/v1/delist`

You can use additional commands, which help test the functionality of the SMASH
server. You can insert a pool manually, for instance, and the file should be
local and not remote:

`curl -X POST -v -H 'content-type: application/octet-stream' http://localhost:3100/api/v1/metadata/i<POOL_ID>/<POOL_HASH> --data-binary @<POOL_JSON_FILE_PATH>`

To reserve a ticker run:

`curl --verbose --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST --data '{"poolHash":"<POOL_HASH>"}' http://localhost:3100/api/v1/tickers/<TICKER_NAME>`

### Testing SMASH

Run commands provided in the example:

`curl --verbose --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request GET http://localhost:3100/api/v1/metadata/8517fa7042cb9494818861c53c87780b4975c0bd402e3ed85168aa66/4b2221a0ac0b0197308323080ba97e3e453f8625393d30f96eebe0fca4cb7335 curl --verbose --user ksaric:cirask --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request PATCH --data '{"poolId":"xyz"}' http://localhost:3100/api/v1/delist`

Note: It is **critical** to work behind HTTPS. Interacting with a server via a
regular HTTP protocol is **unsafe**, since it is using Basic Auth,, which is not
protected, and is visible during such interaction. You need an HTTP server
(Apache or Nginx, for example) that can be configured post-installation to
directly point to the application port.

### Getting the Swagger/OpenAPI Information

First, run the application. Then, go to the localhost and copy the content into
an [editor](https://editor.swagger.io/).

### Using SMASH

**Inserting pool metadata**

This is an example (the hash from Blake2 256), the file should be local and not
remote:

`curl -X POST -v -H 'content-type: application/octet-stream' http://localhost:3100/api/v1/metadata/8517fa7042cb9494818861c53c87780b4975c0bd402e3ed85168aa66/4b2221a0ac0b0197308323080ba97e3e453f8625393d30f96eebe0fca4cb7335 --data-binary @test_pool.json`

**Testing delisting feature**

Find a pool hash that has been inserted:

`curl -X GET -v http://localhost:3100/api/v1/metadata/8517fa7042cb9494818861c53c87780b4975c0bd402e3ed85168aa66/4b2221a0ac0b0197308323080ba97e3e453f8625393d30f96eebe0fca4cb7335 | jq`

Then, test the delisting by sending a PATCH on the delist endpoint:

`curl -X PATCH -v http://localhost:3100/api/v1/delist -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"poolId": "8517fa7042cb9494818861c53c87780b4975c0bd402e3ed85168aa66"}'`

**Or**, if you have a Basic Auth enabled (replace with the username/pass for
your DB) use:

`curl -u ksaric:test -X PATCH -v http://localhost:3100/api/v1/delist -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"poolId": "8517fa7042cb9494818861c53c87780b4975c0bd402e3ed85168aa66"}'`

Fetch the pool:

`curl -X GET -v http://localhost:3100/api/v1/metadata/8517fa7042cb9494818861c53c87780b4975c0bd402e3ed85168aa66/4b2221a0ac0b0197308323080ba97e3e453f8625393d30f96eebe0fca4cb7335 | jq .`

If you have made a mistake by delisting the wrong pool ID, you can whitelist it
(the example with the Basic Auth):

`curl -u ksaric:test -X PATCH -v http://localhost:3100/api/v1/enlist -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"poolId": "8517fa7042cb9494818861c53c87780b4975c0bd402e3ed85168aa66"}'`

Fetch the pool:

`curl -X GET -v http://localhost:3100/api/v1/metadata/8517fa7042cb9494818861c53c87780b4975c0bd402e3ed85168aa66/4b2221a0ac0b0197308323080ba97e3e453f8625393d30f96eebe0fca4cb7335 | jq .`

### Basic AUTH and DB

Before starting, ensure that the Basic Auth flag is disabled. After running the
migration scripts (see sections above), you can insert your user and password
details in the DB. To do that, you can use command line interface (CLI)
commands.

This command creates a new admin user:

`SMASHPGPASSFILE=config/pgpass cabal run smash-exe -- create-admin-user --username ksaric --password cirask`

This CLI command deletes the admin user (the username and the password must
match):

`SMASHPGPASSFILE=config/pgpass cabal run smash-exe -- delete-admin-user --username ksaric --password cirask`

You will now be able to run your SMASH server with user authentication from DB.
If you change your users/passwords, you will need to restart the application,
since it takes a full restart for users to reload.

Note: Any changes to the user tables requires the restart of the application.

### Test Script

First, _ensure_ that the `testing-mode` is enabled on **all** projects.

See an example of how SMASH works:

```
SMASHPGPASSFILE=config/pgpass ./scripts/postgresql-setup.sh --recreatedb
SMASHPGPASSFILE=config/pgpass cabal run smash-exe -- run-migrations --mdir ./schema
SMASHPGPASSFILE=config/pgpass cabal run smash-exe -- create-migration --mdir ./schema
SMASHPGPASSFILE=config/pgpass cabal run smash-exe -- run-migrations --mdir ./schema
```

Then, insert the pool; this is what happens when syncing with the blockchain:

`curl -X POST -v -H 'content-type: application/octet-stream' http://localhost:3100/api/v1/metadata/8517fa7042cb9494818861c53c87780b4975c0bd402e3ed85168aa66/4b2221a0ac0b0197308323080ba97e3e453f8625393d30f96eebe0fca4cb7335 --data-binary @test_pool.json`

Run SMASH:

`SMASHPGPASSFILE=config/pgpass cabal run smash-exe -- run-app`

After the server is running, you can check the hash on the localhost to see it
return the JSON metadata:

```
curl -X GET http://localhost:3100/api/v1/metadata/8517fa7042cb9494818861c53c87780b4975c0bd402e3ed85168aa66/4b2221a0ac0b0197308323080ba97e3e453f8625393d30f96eebe0fca4cb7335
```

### Figuring out the JSON hash

You can use a cardano-cli command to fetch the stake pool metadata hash from a
passive node. Also, you can figure out the JSON hash inside GHCi:

```
ghci
```

```
Prelude> import qualified Cardano.Crypto.Hash.Class as Crypto
Prelude> import qualified Cardano.Crypto.Hash.Blake2b as Crypto
Prelude> import qualified Data.ByteString.Base16 as B16
Prelude> poolMetadata <- readFile "test_pool.json"
Prelude> B16.encode $ Crypto.digest (Proxy :: Proxy Crypto.Blake2b_256) (encodeUtf8 poolMetadata)
```

Note: This assumes that you have a file called "test_pool.json" in your current
directory that contains the JSON metadata for the stake pool.

### Inserting the reserved ticker name

Currently, SMASH service works by allowing users to insert the ticker name and
the hash of the pool they want to be reserved for that ticker name.

There is a CLI utility for doing exactly that. If you want to reserve the ticker
name "SALAD" for the specific metadata hash
"2560993cf1b6f3f1ebde429f062ce48751ed6551c2629ce62e4e169f140a3524", then you
would reserve it like this:

```
curl --verbose --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST --data '{"poolHash":"2560993cf1b6f3f1ebde429f062ce48751ed6551c2629ce62e4e169f140a3524"}' http://localhost:3100/api/v1/tickers/SALAD
```

If someone adds the ticker name that already exists, it will not be returned,
but it will return 404.

### Testing the delisting feature

The example we used for testing shows that we can delist the pool ID. If a pool
is delisted, its pool ID cannot be used in other pools.

To test delisting, first insert the `test_pool.json` as in the example:

```
curl -X POST -v -H 'content-type: application/octet-stream' http://localhost:3100/api/v1/metadata/8517fa7042cb9494818861c53c87780b4975c0bd402e3ed85168aa66/4b2221a0ac0b0197308323080ba97e3e453f8625393d30f96eebe0fca4cb7335 --data-binary @test_pool.json
```

You can then change the ticker name of `test_pool.json` from `testy` to `testo`.
This changes the pool hash.

```
curl -X POST -v -H 'content-type: application/octet-stream' http://localhost:3100/api/v1/metadata/8517fa7042cb9494818861c53c87780b4975c0bd402e3ed85168aa66/3b842358a698119a4b0c0f4934d26cff69190552bf47a85f40f5d1d646c82699 --data-binary @test_pool.json
```

You will now have two pools from the same pool ID. Run this command to see if
they are in the database:

```
curl -X GET -v http://localhost:3100/api/v1/metadata/8517fa7042cb9494818861c53c87780b4975c0bd402e3ed85168aa66/4b2221a0ac0b0197308323080ba97e3e453f8625393d30f96eebe0fca4cb7335 | jq .
curl -X GET -v http://localhost:3100/api/v1/metadata/8517fa7042cb9494818861c53c87780b4975c0bd402e3ed85168aa66/3b842358a698119a4b0c0f4934d26cff69190552bf47a85f40f5d1d646c82699 | jq .
You can try to delist that pool ID and then fetch both pools to see if delisting works on the pool ID level:
curl -X PATCH -v http://localhost:3100/api/v1/delist -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"poolId": "8517fa7042cb9494818861c53c87780b4975c0bd402e3ed85168aa66"}'
Fetching them again should result in 403:
curl -X GET -v http://localhost:3100/api/v1/metadata/8517fa7042cb9494818861c53c87780b4975c0bd402e3ed85168aa66/4b2221a0ac0b0197308323080ba97e3e453f8625393d30f96eebe0fca4cb7335 | jq .
curl -X GET -v http://localhost:3100/api/v1/metadata/8517fa7042cb9494818861c53c87780b4975c0bd402e3ed85168aa66/3b842358a698119a4b0c0f4934d26cff69190552bf47a85f40f5d1d646c82699 | jq .
```

This assumes that you have a file called `test_pool.json` in your current
directory that contains the JSON metadata for the stake pool.

### Checking the pool rejection errors

Currently, you can check if there are any errors while trying to download the
pool metadata. The hash might sometimes be wrong, or the server URL could return
404, etc.

To check whether anything went wrong, you can add a specific pool ID
(`c0b0e43213a8c898e373928fbfc3df81ee77c0df7dadc3ad6e5bae17`) in the following
command:

```
http://localhost:3100/api/v1/errors/062693863e0bcf9f619238f020741381d4d3748aae6faf1c012e80e7
```

This shows all the pool errors from the previous day. You can filter these
errors by using a date format like DD.MM.YYYY:

```
http://localhost:3100/api/v1/errors/6b6164af70861c5537cc9c8e50fdae35139ca2c8c6fbb42e8b7e6bfb?fromDate=13.10.2020
```

The returned list consists of the following objects containing:

- **time** - the time formatted in DD.MM.YYYY. HH:MM:SS which is one of the most
  convenient formats
- **utcTime** - the time formatted in the standard UTC format
- **poolId** - the pool ID of the pool’s owner
- **poolHash** - the hash of the pool’s metadata
- **cause** - the cause (reasoning) of the error or failure
- **retryCount** - the number of times a user (re)tried to fetch the offline
  metadata

### Unregistering a pool

If a pool is unregistered, all its metadata becomes unavailable. To check which
pools have been unregistered, run this command:

```
curl --verbose --header "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:3100/api/v1/retired
```

## RUNNING THE SMASH SERVER

You can find the most recent instructions on running the SMASH server in the
respective
[SMASH GitHub repository](https://github.com/input-output-hk/smash/blob/master/doc/getting-started/how-to-run-smash.md).

Running a SMASH server must be done in a certain order. First, you need to run
your node, as it fetches the required blocks and online information from the
blockchain. A SMASH server also requires the Postgresql database to be running.

Follow these steps to run the SMASH service.

### Run the Node

Clone the node and use Nix to build it. You can download specific versions of
the node from this
[release page](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/releases),

You can also clone the repository and use a specific tag from the release (e.g.,
1.14.2):

```
git clone git@github.com:input-output-hk/cardano-node.git

git checkout 1.14.2 -b tag-1.14.2
```

#### Building and running the node on the testnet

Once you have the node version you want, build the node on the testnet using
Nix:

```
nix-build -A scripts.shelley_testnet.node -o shelley-testnet-node
```

Then, you can run the node with:

```
./shelley-testnet-node
```

#### Building and running the node on the mainnet

After you have the version you wish to work with, build the node on the mainnet
ususing Nix: nix-build -A scripts.mainnet.node -o mainnet-node-local

Then, you can run the node with:

```
./mainnet-node-local
```

### Build SMASH

[Download](https://github.com/input-output-hk/smash/releases) the latest SMASH
version.

You can then build the project using Stack, Cabal or Nix:

```
nix-build -o smash-local
```

You can now set up the DB schema.

### Setting up a Postgresql DB Using SMASH

Follow these steps to set up a Postgresql database to use SMASH.

1. Create the preferred schema and you can use SMASH to populate it. For this,
   you will need a connection string.. For example, this is the content for
   `config/pgpass`, which can be used to connect to the database:

```
/var/run/postgresql:5432:smash:*:*
```

2. Create a schema, point the schema name, port the number to correct values,
   and finally, store that information in a file. We will later use the location
   of that file to connect to the database and populate it.

For example:

```
SMASHPGPASSFILE=config/pgpass ./scripts/postgresql-setup.sh --createdb
```

3. Run the migration required for SMASH to work. Use the database config file:

```
SMASHPGPASSFILE=config/pgpass ./smash-local run-migrations --mdir ./schema
```

Once completed, you should have a valid schema and should be able to run SMASH!

### Run SMASH

Before running SMASH, ensure that the node is running (see sections above), and
use another terminal session to run SMASH. Use the appropriate parameters, since
running the server requires it to be in sync with the node.

The socket path should point to a socket that will be used for communication
with the node.

For example:

```
SMASHPGPASSFILE=config/pgpass ./smash-local run-app-with-db-sync --config config/testnet-config.yaml --socket-path ../cardano-node/state-node-shelley_testnet/node.socket --schema-dir schema/ --state-dir ledger-state/shelley-testnet
```

After this, the SMASH application should start syncing blocks and reflecting
pools.

### Running Tests

You can run tests using Stack:

```
stack test --fast -j`nproc` --flag 'smash:testing-mode' --flag 'smash-servant-types:testing-mode'
```

Or Cabal:

```
cabal test all -f testing-mode

### Checking if it works

When you see that a pool has been registered, you can obtain information about
it by running its poolid and hash (the example of the hash here is
`93b13334b5edf623fd4c7a716f3cf47be5baf7fb3a431c16ee07aab8ff074873`):

```
curl -X GET -v http://localhost:3100/api/v1/metadata/062693863e0bcf9f619238f020741381d4d3748aae6faf1c012e80e7/93b13334b5edf623fd4c7a716f3cf47be5baf7fb3a431c16ee07aab8ff074873
```

You can test the delisting by sending a PATCH on the delist endpoint (using the
pool id from the example,
`062693863e0bcf9f619238f020741381d4d3748aae6faf1c012e80e7`):

```
curl -X PATCH -v http://localhost:3100/api/v1/delist -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"poolId": "062693863e0bcf9f619238f020741381d4d3748aae6faf1c012e80e7"}'
```

If you have Basic Auth enabled (remember to replace the username/password you
have in your DB), run:

```
curl -u ksaric:cirask -X PATCH -v http://localhost:3100/api/v1/delist -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"poolId": "062693863e0bcf9f619238f020741381d4d3748aae6faf1c012e80e7"}'
```

### Running a stub server for local testing purposes

If you wish to run a stub server for local testing purposes, build SMASH in
testing mode:

```
stack install --flag 'smash:testing-mode' --flag 'smash-servant-types:testing-mode' --flag 'smash:disable-basic-auth'
smash-exe run-stub-app
curl -X POST -v -H 'content-type: application/octet-stream' --data-binary @test_pool.json \
http://localhost:3100/api/v1/metadata/5ee7591bf30eaa4f5dce70b4a676eb02d5be8012d188f04fe3beffb0/cc019105f084aef2a956b2f7f2c0bf4e747bf7696705312c244620089429df6f
curl -X GET -v \
http://localhost:3100/api/v1/metadata/5ee7591bf30eaa4f5dce70b4a676eb02d5be8012d188f04fe3beffb0/cc019105f084aef2a956b2f7f2c0bf4e747bf7696705312c244620089429df6f

## SMASH METADATA MANAGEMENT

This section outlines the peculiarities of working with an existing SMASH
server, in particular - the one moderated by IOHK.

### How does the IOHK SMASH server work?

The first generation of SMASH is initially deployed by IOHK and is used in the
Daedalus delegation center, where it provides the ability to view available
stake pools with verified names, ticker symbols, and websites:

Daedalus also allows users to configure any server of their choice and browse
custom stake pool lists:

The IOHK SMASH server:

- runs continuously and autonomously;
- follows the blockchain data to track the stake pool registration or
  re-registration;
- downloads stake pool metadata from on-chain locations;
- is robust against incorrectly configured or malicious metadata hosting (e.g.
  timeouts, resource limits);
- verifies metadata content against the on-chain registered hash;
- verifies the size is within the limits, and the content matches the necessary
  JSON scheme;
- serves requested metadata via an API to wallets and other users in a
  performant way, including for the case of incremental updates;
- indicates that metadata is not available in response to requests;
- serves the requested metadata preserving the content hash to be verified
  against the hash from the on-chain registration certificate;
- allows operators to delist stake pools;
- allows operators to configure, check and adjust their chosen policy via an
  appropriate interface without service interruptions;
- follows typical behaviours, e.g. configured via CLI and/or configuration file,
  stdout/stderr logging.

### Delisting a stake pool

Cardano reserves the right to delist pools that, based on their metadata, might
be deemed to be harmful, offensive, or contain material that might be
objectionable.

Below is a step-by-step description of actions that can be taken when you
identify a pool with a duplicated ticker name or offensive content. Note that
these actions apply to the SMASH server run and maintained by IOHK _only_.

### Possible reasons for delisting a pool

First, determine that there is a valid reason for a stake pool to be delisted.
Certain reasons influence the delisting decision.

These include:

- **illegal or malicious content**: a stake pool that features any illegal,
  abusive, or malicious content as part of the stake pool metadata (for example
  via the link to the SPO’s homepage).
- **impersonation**: stake pools attempting to impersonate individuals, groups,
  or organizations in a misleading, confusing, or deceptive manner. For example,
  a successful stake pool called POOL being obviously impersonated by another
  called P00L (by linking to the same website).
- **previous ‘claim’**: ticker names can be registered by stake pool operators
  (SPOs) on a ‘first come - first served’ basis, however, a ticker name that was
  registered on the Incentivized Testnet (ITN) can only be registered on the
  Cardano mainnet by the same SPO that registered such a ticker on the ITN.
  Ticker names that were registered on the ITN but were not re-registered on the
  Cardano mainnet by 19th June 2020 will be released and available for
  registration on the Cardano mainnet.
- **an inappropriate ticker name**: a ticker name that might be deemed by others
  obscene, sexually explicit, offensive, hurtful, profane, or otherwise
  inappropriate. This is a subjective judgment in some cases, so best efforts
  will always be made.
- **intellectual property rights (IPR) violations**: SPOs that violate the
  intellectual property rights of others -including copyright and trademarks-,
  where proof can be supplied.
- **inactive or retired pools**: stake pools that are retired or have not
  produced blocks in a long time, or pools whose operator cannot be contacted.
  Retired pools on the mainnet have a limit of six months within which to make a
  request for their ticker name to be re-registered.

### How to request a delisting

When you identify a stake pool that you believe should be delisted, you can send
an official request for delisting to [this email address](mailto:smash@iohk.io).
Include your rationale and any proof of why a delisting is, in your opinion,
warranted. In particular, state one of the above reasons and provide a detailed
explanation. Stake pools impersonating trademarks should be reported by the
trademark holder or their authorized representative. After sending your request,
you will receive an acknowledgement email and the request will be taken into
consideration.

A SMASH operator will review the request to ensure that the reasoning and proofs
are accurate and will make a decision on whether or not to delist the stake
pool. It may also be determined that further arbitration or community
consultation is required. However, the ultimate decision will always be reserved
by the entity operating the SMASH server in question.

When a decision is made, you will receive an email outlining whether the stake
pool will be delisted or whether the ticker listing will be allowed to remain.
In either case, we’ll always provide an explanation or justification for the
choice. In some cases, a stake pool can be delisted proactively - whether
temporarily or permanently. With delisting in active, the stake pool will not be
visible on SMASH, and its operator will need to make a case if they want the
decision reversed. If an SPO believes that delisting their stake pool has
happened by mistake, they can submit an appeal to
[this email address](mailto:smash@iohk.io).

IOHK’s SMASH operator is constantly reviewing all requests from the Cardano
community and SPOs to ensure that all the stake pool information is tracked and
managed accurately. A request is usually processed in 7 working days.

It is important to note that delisting refers to the display of metadata and
listing with SMASH only. As a decentralized network, at no point will stake pool
operations themselves be affected.

If you need further information or clarification about delisting, you can
contact [this email address](mailto:smash@iohk.io).
