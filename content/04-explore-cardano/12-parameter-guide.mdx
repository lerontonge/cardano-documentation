Protocol parameters on Cardano are the various settings that define the blockchain's behavior. Some protocol parameters are stable and non-updatable while others can be adjusted to adapt to changing conditions over time.

Examples of important Cardano protocol parameters include the maximum block size, the transaction fee structure, the block production schedule, and the minimum ada balance required for staking (read more in the following sections). Parameter choices can have a significant impact on the network's performance, security, and usability, and their alteration must be carefully considered.

The Voltaire governance system for Cardano aims to provide a flexible and adaptable framework that can evolve over time. This includes monitoring and changing the various protocol parameters. The collaboration of founding entities (Input Output Global, the Cardano Foundation, and EMURGO) with the community allows for a decentralized approach to governance and decision making. Cardano can then respond to changing conditions and optimize its performance and functionality to meet the needs of its users.

Additionally, the use of protocol parameters allows for agility and innovation within the network, as new ideas and proposals can be tested and implemented without requiring a [hard fork](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/hard-fork) or other disruptive changes to the network's architecture. This enables Cardano to remain at the forefront of blockchain technology and provide a robust and sustainable infrastructure for decentralized applications (DApps) and services.

## Types of protocol parameters on Cardano

Cardano protocol parameters are classified as follows:

-   **Network parameters** – affect Cardano’s connectivity properties and performance. Examples include the maximum number of connections allowed per node, peer discovery algorithm, the network propagation speed, block body and header size, transaction size, etc.
-   **Economic parameters** – affect the economic aspects of blockchain operations. Examples include parameters such as the transaction fee structure, the minimum ada balance required for staking or transacting, stake pool fees, treasury settings, etc.
-   **Technical parameters** – affect technical protocol properties like the consensus algorithm or cost models, for example. These include the stake pool pledge influence, a target number of stake pools, collateral percentage, and others.
-   **Governance parameters** – as Voltaire is rolled out, a new class of parameters will be introduced to define the governance process.
    
Protocol parameters are either updatable or non-updatable:

-   **Updatable** parameters can be adjusted through governance processes. These parameters can be used to change the operation of the block-producing protocol, vary transaction fees, define the influence of pledge, etc.
-   **Non-updatable** parameters affect the fundamentals of the Cardano protocol and are stable, which means that they cannot be changed except via a hard fork. Non-updatable parameters include those defining the genesis block or basic security properties, for example. Some non-updatable parameters may be embedded in the source code or implemented as software. Each major protocol version defines its own set of updatable and non-updatable parameters.
 
Updatable parameters are designed to be flexible and adaptable, allowing the network to evolve over time in response to changing conditions and community needs. Non-updatable parameters, on the other hand, are typically set at the launch of the network or when introducing major changes to the protocol and are intended to provide a stable and secure foundation for the network's operations.
