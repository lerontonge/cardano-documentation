## Downloading pre-compiled executables

You can install the Cardano node and the CLI using
[pre-compiled executable files](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node#executables)
for your platform.

## Building from source

Alternatively, if you want to build from source, there are two options
available to you. Depending on your build tool preference, you can build from
the source code using either of the following:

- [cabal: building the node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node-wiki/blob/main/docs/getting-started/install.md)
- [Nix: building the node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node-wiki/blob/main/docs/getting-started/building-the-node-using-nix.md)

Please refer to the [cardano-node releases page](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/releases/latest) to ensure you are working with the latest version of the node.

Once you have installed the node, you need to
[specify the configuration parameters](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node-wiki/blob/main/docs/getting-started/understanding-config-files.md).

## Using Docker

You can also use a Docker image to build your Cardano node. For more details, see [this explainer](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node-wiki/blob/main/docs/Docker.md).
