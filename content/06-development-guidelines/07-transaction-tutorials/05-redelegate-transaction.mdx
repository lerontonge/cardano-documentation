This tutorial will show how to redelegate your stake to another stake pool. There can be multiple reasons to redelegate your stake, but the most common ones are:

- Original stake pool is no longer available
- You've discovered a more convenient option
- You have your own stake pool and you want to delegate your stake to it.

To do that, you need to create a new certificate that you are sending in a transaction, as in the first part of the tutorial:

```
cardano-cli stake-address delegation-certificate \
    --stake-verification-key-file stake.vkey \
    --stake-pool-id pool1vzqtn3mtfvvuy8ghksy34gs9g97tszj5f8mr3sn7asy5vk577ec \
    --out-file new-delegation.cert
```

Now the delegation certificate contains the `--stake-pool-id` of the new stake pool. It means that you're ready to build your transaction, selecting the UTXO from which you will pay the fee:

```
$ cardano-cli query utxo --address $(cat payment.addr)
                           TxHash                                 TxIx        Amount

```

Build:

```
cardano-cli transaction build \
    --witness-override 2 \
    --tx-in 2b1bfc342c1f5531df4cfa220eac79574142c7263d97885d2ad8588ca1a7e22b#0 \
    --change-address $(cat payment.addr) \
    --certificate new-delegation.cert \
    --out-file new-delegation.tx

Sign:

cardano-cli transaction sign \
    --tx-file new-delegation.tx \
    --signing-key-file payment.skey \
    --signing-key-file stake.skey \
    --out-file new-delegation.signed

cardano-cli transaction submit --tx-file new-delegation.signed 
```

If you check your stake address details, you'll see that you have delegated your stake to a new stake pool and you have zero rewards for now:

```
$ cardano-cli query stake-address-info --address $(cat stake.addr)
[
    {
        "address": "stake_test1uq954t492tmusk2dy9z505g3cz3sfpnh0swsqjmzk47rasqyn8uqp",
        "delegation": "pool1vzqtn3mtfvvuy8ghksy34gs9g97tszj5f8mr3sn7asy5vk577ec",
        "rewardAccountBalance": 0
    }
]
```
