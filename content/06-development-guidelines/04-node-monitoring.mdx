Regular monitoring of active nodes is crucial to determine if the node is running optimally, if the system is performant, or if fine-tuning is required.

Activate a trace on the node to access metrics, including network traffic, memory usage, and general blockchain data. For details, see:

-   [Configuring logging](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node-wiki/blob/main/docs/logging-monitoring/logging.md)
    
You can then choose a toolset to monitor your node:

-   [Monitoring the node with EKG](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node-wiki/blob/main/docs/logging-monitoring/ekg.md)
-   [Using a Grafana Dashboard](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node-wiki/blob/main/docs/logging-monitoring/grafana.md)
-   [Monitoring the node in real time with RTView](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-components/cardano-rtview)
-   [Monitoring the node with Prometheus](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node-wiki/blob/main/docs/logging-monitoring/prometheus.md)

You can also see video tutorials and Cardano Course handbook material:
